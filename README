This is a simple setup to automatically copy stuff from IOS devices
(like an Ipad) to a Linux system when plugged in via USB.

Copy the files over like this:

cp ipad-sync /usr/local/sbin/ipad-sync
cp ipad-sync@.service /etc/systemd/system/ipad-sync@.service
cp 90-ipad-sync.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/90-ipad-sync.rules

And then adjust everything so that it works for you.  The ipad-sync
script is basically a template to be altered to your needs.
